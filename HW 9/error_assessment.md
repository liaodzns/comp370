Annotators disagreed when there was an occasional reddit title that had a purpose unrelated to the environment. For example, "Looking for courses/programs with hot girls" - While one annotator believed this falls under Academics and Courses, another believed this is more related to Social Life based on the purpose of the post. The course content was not actually discussed, and therefore this is more of a social label.
