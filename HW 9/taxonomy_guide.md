# Reddit Data Taxonomy Guide
## 1. Motivation
The primary purpose of this taxonomy is to categorize Reddit posts from McGill and Concordia subreddits into specific themes to facilitate structured analysis. These categories enable a better understanding of the discussions and issues relevant to students, fostering insights into student life, academics, social activities, and support needs. The taxonomy helps maintain consistency in coding, reduces ambiguity, and ensures a clear framework for data interpretation.

This guide serves as a reference for coders, ensuring that posts are categorized accurately and consistently, particularly for posts that may be ambiguous or contain multiple themes. By outlining clear definitions, examples, and edge cases, this taxonomy enhances reliability in data coding and helps avoid misclassification.
