1. It is always good practice to analyze why a certain item did not get a perfect or majority agreement. At times, the piece of data may act as an edge case to let you know something needs to be fixed - either the typology, annotators, training, etc.

2. A = 3 C = 1 B = 2
    From what I can understand, A is the most concrete idea - there is a clear idea of what to measure and when to measure. 

    Next, B is harder to measure than A - we are no longer looking at overall foot traffic, but instead are focusing on individuals. We can apply the "are there any?" prompt here: "Are there any locations ...?" However it is possible to measure since St Laurent is a street of many establishments.
    
    Finally, C is definitely  fishing because you start to look at the individuals themselves - in that case, it is difficult to analyze each individuals diets because everyone has their own opinions and needs.

3. You can narrow down C by specifying a specific establihsment - this  decreases the population of people you need to measure. This will make the experiment more tangible.

4. In automated data annotation, we give an algorithm our data and output labels. However, the act of creating this algorithm is a data science project itself - we have to measure how well our algorithm works. The inputs of this second project are the labels that it outputs are used to assess the question, and the annotation happens when we annotate ourselves.

5. a. Definition: an airplane is vehicle faster than a car that can go in the sky.

    b. Motivation: we have stoplights to prevent traffic accidents and ensure safety of all drivers.

    c. Motivation: Only when there is a fire, or another extreme emergency that endangers everyones' lives.

    d. Process: Wash the apple, peel if necessary, cut the apple, eat the apple.
