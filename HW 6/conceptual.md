1. What is refactoring? Give three examples of refactoring techniques. 

Refactoring is the process of improving the structure of existing code without changing its external behavior.
3 Examples:
- Removing duplicate code
- Renaming variables
- Changing the structure of the code to make it more modular


2. In a data science project, why does code naturally go through “phases” of messiness? 

Code naturally goes through phases of messiness because as the complexity of the code increases, it becomes more difficult to maintain. This is because the code becomes more complex and harder to understand.

3. What are three techniques for creating more modular code?

    1. Using functions
    2. Using classes
    3. Using modules
