Four reasons why a cloud machine is better than a laptop:
    1. A cloud machine has more storage than your laptop ever will 
    2. A cloud machine will have better hardware (GPUs that a laptop may not have)
    3. A cloud machine can be closer in proximity to the data you wish to access for efficiency
    4. A cloud machine is always running and does not pose the issue of turning off in the middle of tasks
